title = "A ghosting artifact detector for interpolated image quality assessment"
abstract = "We present a no-reference image quality metric for image interpolation. The approach is capable of detecting blurry regions as well as ghosting artifacts, e.g., in image based rendering scenarios. Based on the assumption that ghosting artifacts can be detected locally, perceived visual quality can be predicted from the amount of regions that are affected by ghosting. Because the approach does not require any reference image, it is very suitable, e.g., for assessing quality of image-based rendering techniques in general settings."
