abstract = "This contribution reports the results of the SHREC 2013 track: Retrieval on Textured 3D Models, whose goal is to evaluate the performance of retrieval algorithms when models vary either by geometric shape or texture, or both. The collection to search in is made of 240 textured mesh models, divided into 10 classes. Each model has been used in turn as a query against the remaining part of the database. For a given query, the goal was to retrieve the most similar objects. The track saw six participants and the submission of eleven runs."
