title = "A State Of the Art Report on Research in Multiple RGB-D sensor Setups"
abstract = "That the Microsoft Kinect, an RGB-D sensor, transformed the gaming and end consumer sector has been anticipated by the developers. That it also impacted in rigorous computer vision research has probably been a surprise to the whole community. Shortly before the commercial deployment of its successor, Kinect One, the research literature fills with resumees and state-of-the art papers to summarize the development over the past 3 years. This chapter describes significant research projects which have built on sensoring setups that include two or more RGB-D sensors in one scene and on RGB-D datasets captured with them which were made publicly available."
