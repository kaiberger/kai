title = "Markerless motion capture using multiple color-depth sensors"
abstract = "With the advent of the Microsoft Kinect, renewed focus has been put on monocular depth-based motion capturing. However, this approach is limited in that an actor has to move facing the camera. Due to the active light nature of the sensor, no more than one device has been used for motion capturing so far. In effect, any pose estimation must fail for poses occluded to the depth camera. Our work investigates on reducing or mitigating the detrimental effects of multiple active light emitters, thereby allowing motion capture from all angles. We systematically evaluate the concurrent use of one to four Kinects, including calibration, error measures and analysis, and present a time-multiplexing approach."
