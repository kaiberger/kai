title = "Tomographic 4D Reconstruction of Gas Flows in the Presence of Occluders"
abstract = "We present a method that allows for reconstructing non-stationary, time-varying gas flows around moving objects. Our work extends the background oriented Schlieren tomography (3D-BOS) acquisition technique to capture gas flows also in the presence of occluding objects. An algorithm is presented that exploits the unique properties of BOS background patterns to robustly segment occluding objects. Numerical issues in the refractive index field reconstruction are addressed and successfully solved by the new method."
