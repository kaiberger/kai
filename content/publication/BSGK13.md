title = "Using sparse optical flow for multiple Kinect applications"
abstract = "The use of Multiple Microsoft Kinects has become prominent in the last two years and enjoyed widespread acceptance. While several work has been published to mitigate quality degradations in the precomputed depth image, this work focuses on employing an optical flow suitable for dot patterns as employed in the Kinect to retrieve subtle scene data alterations for reconstruction. The method is employed in a multiple Kinect vision architecture to detect the interface of propane flow around occluding objects in air."
