abstract = "This project investigates multi-camera setups using Microsoft Kinects. Active structured light from the Kinect is used in several scenarious, including gas flow description, motion capture and free-viewpoint video. While the ability to capture depth alongside color data (RGB-D) is the starting point of the investigations, the structured light is also used more directly. In order to combine Kinects with passive recording approaches, common calibration with HD cameras is also a topic."
