title = "A state of the art report on kinect sensor setups in computer vision"
abstract = "During the last three years after the launch of the Microsoft Kinect in the end-consumer market we have become witnesses of a small revolution in computer vision research towards the use of a standardized consumer-grade RGBD sensor for scene content retrieval. Beside classical localization and motion capturing tasks the Kinect has successfully been employed for the reconstruction of opaque and transparent objects. This report gives a comprehensive overview over the main publications using the Microsoft Kinect out of its original context as a decision-forest based motion-capturing tool."
