title = "Measuring BRDFs of Immersed Materials"
abstract = "We investigate the effect of immersing real-world materials into media of different refractive indices. We show, that only some materials follow the Fresnel-governed behaviour. In reality, many materials exhibit unexpected effects such as stronger localized highlights or a significant increase in the glossy reflection due to microgeometry. In this paper, we propose a new measurement technique that allows for measuring the BRDFs of materials that are immersed into different media."
